# Factorio Mod Template

This is a template repository for a new Factorio mod based on [flib](https://github.com/factoriolib/flib). I made this for myself, but feel free to use it for your own mods as well if you like.

**NOTE:** if you use the template, _do not_ clone your repository into your `mods` folder! Clone it to a development folder, then symlink (junction) the `src` subfolder into `mods`.
